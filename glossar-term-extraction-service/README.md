# The G(TE)<sup>2</sup> Service


## Technical Overview
This server is generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

This server uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.
